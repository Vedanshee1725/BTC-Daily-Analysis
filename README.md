# Bitcoin Time Series Analysis
This project performs an in-depth time series analysis on 14 years of daily Bitcoin data to model its inherent volatility and market dynamics.

## Key Methodologies:
* __Decomposition & Transformation__: The raw time series was decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Log transformations were applied to stabilise variance and normalise the data.

* __Correlation Analysis__: Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots were used to identify the underlying structure and lags in the data.

* __Predictive Modeling__: An Autoregressive (AR) model was engineered and evaluated to test the predictive stability of the series, laying the essential groundwork for future multivariate forecasting efforts.
